# How to protect your wallet funds

### Step 1 - Enable Phone and App Security

Use only the authentic version of Starbase Wallet. Download the App exclusively from the links provided on our website: [www.deploystarship.com](http://www.deploystarship.com) Installing the most recent version also provides security fixes and optimized performance.

Never install Starbase Wallet onto a rooted device. Keep your device free of any malware, do not download malicious apps. Always get the most recent updates and security patches for your device. **Lock your phone, or set it to automatically lock itself when not in use.**

Starbase Wallet allows you to prevent unauthorized access by putting a **passcode on the app** itself. With this feature, you must authenticate every time you launch the Starbase Wallet. You can enable passcode protection in Settings.

### Step 2 - Secure your Private Key 

The Private Key is a crucial element for the security of your Starbase Wallet. If your device is lost, damaged or stolen, you can use your private key to restore access to your entire wallet. 

Therefore, it is important to keep your Private Keys safe. It is strongly recommended to store your Private Key offline. Write it down on a piece of paper and keep it at a secure vault.

### Step 3 - Educate Yourself

Anyone who knows your Private Key can access your wallet and have full control of your funds. **When your funds are stolen or lost, we cannot help you retrieve them.**

Here are some tips to keep in mind:

- **Never** enter your Private Key on any website.
- **Never** share your Private Key to anyone. Unless you want to give them access to your funds.
- Starbase Wallet staff will **never** message you directly for any promotions or giveaways.
- Starbase Wallet staff will **never** have a reason to ask you for your private key.
- **Always** get news and updates from official Starbase Wallet social media channels and site.
