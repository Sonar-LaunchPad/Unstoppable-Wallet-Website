# How does Starbase Wallet work?

- Starbase Wallet is like a browser for blockchains. Via Starbase wallet you can interact with blockchains, see your balance of funds stored on blockchain.
- No crypto is stored on Starbase Wallet itself. That's not how it works. All the funds are stored on blockchain. Starbase gives you access to them.
- Starbase Wallet is free to download and does not earn anything when you use it.Â Fees are all paid to the miners or validators of crypto networks.
- Starbase Wallet helps you interact with blockchain, in order to send and receive cryptos.
